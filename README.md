>  SketchAgent leverages an off-the-shelf multimodal LLM to facilitate language-driven, sequential sketch generation through an intuitive sketching language. It can sketch diverse concepts, engage in interactive sketching with humans, and edit content via chat.
</p>

## Setup
Clone the repository and navigate to the project folder:
```
git clone https://github.com/yael-vinker/SketchAgent.git
cd SketchAgent
```
Set up the environment:
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate sketch_agent
```

**For Mac users**, use the following environment file instead:
```
conda env create -f mac_environment.yml
conda activate sketch_agent
```
If python flashes a warning at you, try reinstalling `cairosvg`:
```
conda uninstall cairosvg && conda install cairosvg
```

#### API Key
This repository requires an Anthropic API key. If you don't have one, [create an Anthropic account](https://console.anthropic.com/login) and follow the instructions to obtain a key.

Once you have the key, save it in the ```.env``` file:
```
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=<your_key>
```

# Start Sketching! :woman_artist: :art:
## Text-to-Sketch
Generate a single sketch by running:
```
python gen_sketch.py --concept_to_draw "<your_concept_here>" 
```
For example:
```
python gen_sketch.py --concept_to_draw "sailboat" 
```

Optional arguments:
* ```--seed_mode``` Default is ```"deterministic"``` for reproducible results. Set to ```"stochastic"``` for increased variability.
* ```--path2save``` By default, results are saved to ```results/test/```.

## Collaborative Sketching
Collaborate with SketchAgent by alternating strokes! 
To use the interactive interface:
```
python collab_sketch.py
```
This will launch a Flask-based web application. Once running, look for the following output in the terminal:
```
Server running at: http://<your-ip-address>:5000
```
Open the provided URL in your web browser to interact with the application. Results are saved to ```results/collab_sketching/```.
Use the text box to change the concept to be drawn.

## Chat-Based Editing

<br>

Interact with SketchAgent through natural language to edit existing sketches! To use the chat-based editing interface:

```bash
python chat_and_edit.py
```

This will launch a Flask-based web application. Once running, look for output like:

```
Server running at: http://<your-ip-address>:5000
```

You can then:

* Give **textual instructions** to edit specific sketch elements
* Add new elements through **natural conversation**

Results are saved to:

```
results/api_{timestamp}_{session_id}
```

### 🧑‍💻 Accessing the Interface

#### ✅ If Running Locally:

Open the printed URL (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:5000`) in your browser.

#### 🔐 If Running Remotely via SSH:

Use **SSH port forwarding** to access the app from your local browser:

1. On your local machine (not the server), forward the port:

   ```bash
   ssh -L 5000:localhost:5000 your_username@remote_server_ip
   ```

2. Once connected and the app is running, open:

   ```
   http://localhost:5000
   ```

   in your local browser. This securely tunnels traffic to the remote Flask app.




## Tips:
* The ```gen_sketch.py``` script produces sketches with variability. Try running it multiple times to explore different outcomes.
* Prompts are available in the ```prompts.py file```. For unique concepts, ensure that your input prompt is clear and meaningful.

## TODOs

- [ ] Add support for chat based editing.
- [ ] Add SVG drawing process animations in HTML.
- [ ] Add support of other backbone models (GPT4o, LLama3).
